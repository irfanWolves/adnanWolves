Clone for the first time by using git clone ON AN EMPTY folder on your machine
Perform git init to start
Create, edit, drag and drop or do whatever in this folder
Whenever you will make any changes to any files in this folder, you can check it by using "git status"

If you want to compare your local copy with the server copy (in case if someone added something on the server), you can do "git fetch"

1. Use "git add <name of a file to be added to your git repo"> to add any files 
2. Use "git commit -m "any comments"
3. Use "git push" to push your changes to your remote server
